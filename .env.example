# Optional: OpenAI API Key for enhanced AI feedback
# If not provided, the system will use advanced rule-based fallback feedback

# Note: The AI feedback system works in three modes:
# 1. Full AI mode: When Supabase is configured AND OpenAI API key is set
# 2. Fallback mode: When Supabase is configured but no OpenAI key (uses advanced rule-based feedback)
# 3. Demo mode: When Supabase is not configured (uses sophisticated local analysis)
